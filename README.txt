This project was my final exam in the course 'Webbutveckling 1'.
The project was only supposed to be written with vanilla HTML&CSS without JS.

Some of the criterias:
- Responsive layout using flexbox
- Following all "Webbriktlinjer"(WCAG by W3C) from priority 1 & minimum 5 from the other ones.
- Optimised image files.
- User friendly interface (by being consistent, logical, accessible through keyboard or screenreader)
- No framework or Javascript.
